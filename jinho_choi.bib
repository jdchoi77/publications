	abstract = {We present an algorithm based on multi-layer transformers for identifying Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in social media data. Our model relies on the properties of the problem and the characteristics of contextual word embeddings to extract two views from documents. Then a classifier is trained on each view to label a set of unlabeled documents to be used as an initializer for a new classifier in the other view. Finally, the initialized classifier in each view is further trained using the initial training examples. We evaluated our model in the largest publicly available ADR dataset. The experiments testify that our model significantly outperforms the transformer-based models pretrained on domain-specific data.},

@inproceedings{lu:21a,
	abstract = {Salience Estimation aims to predict term importance in documents.
Due to few existing human-annotated datasets and the subjective notion of salience, previous studies typically generate pseudo-ground truth for evaluation. However, our investigation reveals that the evaluation protocol proposed by prior work is difficult to replicate, thus leading to few follow-up studies existing. Moreover, the evaluation process is problematic: the entity linking tool used for entity matching is very noisy, while the ignorance of event argument for event evaluation leads to boosted performance. In this work, we propose a light yet practical entity and event salience estimation evaluation protocol, which incorporates the more reliable syntactic dependency parser. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis among popular entity and event definition standards, and present our own definition for the Salience Estimation task to reduce noise during the pseudo-ground truth generation process. Furthermore, we construct dependency-based heterogeneous graphs to capture the interactions of entities and events. The empirical results show that both baseline methods and the novel GNN method utilizing the heterogeneous graph consistently outperform the previous SOTA model in all proposed metrics.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of higher-order inference (HOI) on the task of coreference resolution. HOI has been adapted by almost all recent coreference resolution models without taking much investigation on its true effectiveness over representation learning. To make a comprehensive analysis, we implement an end-to-end coreference system as well as four HOI approaches, attended antecedent, entity equalization, span clustering, and cluster merging, where the latter two are our original methods.We find that given a high-performing encoder such as SpanBERT, the impact of HOI is negative to marginal, providing a new perspective of HOI to this task. Our best model using cluster merging shows the Avg-F1 of 80.2, that is the new state-of-the-art result for this task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study on resume classification to reduce the time and labor needed to screen an overwhelming number of applications significantly, while improving the selection of suitable candidates. A total of 6,492 resumes are extracted from 24,933 job applications for 252 positions designated into four levels of experience for Clinical ResearchCoordinators (CRC). Each resume is manually annotated to its most appropriate CRC position by experts through several rounds of triple annotation to establish guidelines.  As a result, a high Kappa score of 61% is achieved for inter-annotator agreement. Given this dataset, novel transformer-based classification models are developed for two tasks: the first task takes a resume and classifies it to a CRC level (T1), and the second task takes both a resume and a job description to apply and predicts if the application is suited to the job (T2). Our best models using section encoding and multi-head attention decoding give results of 73.3% toT1and79.2% toT2.  Our analysis shows that the prediction errors are mostly made among adjacent CRC levels, which are hard for even experts to distinguish, implying the practical value of our models in real HR platforms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to extract noise in long clinical documents for the task of readmission prediction after kidney transplant. We face the challenges of developing robust models on a small dataset where each document may consist of over 10K tokens with full of noise including tabular text. %each patient can have thousands of tokens in noisy documents. We first experiment four types of encoders to empirically decide the best document representation, and then apply reinforcement learning to remove noisy text from the long documents, which models the noise extraction process as a sequential decision problem. Our results show that the old bag-of-words encoder outperforms deep learning-based encoders on this task, and reinforcement learning is able to improve upon baseline while pruning out 25\% text segments. Our analysis depicts that reinforcement learning is able to identify both typical noisy tokens and task-specific noisy text.},

@inproceedings{he:20b,
	abstract = {This paper presents our enhanced dependency parsing approach using transformer encoders, coupled with a simple yet powerful ensemble algorithm that takes advantage of both tree and graph dependency parsing. Two types of transformer encoders are compared, a multilingual encoder and language-specific encoders. Our dependency tree parsing (DTP) approach generates only primary dependencies to form trees whereas our dependency graph parsing (DGP) approach handles both primary and secondary dependencies to form graphs. Since DGP does not guarantee the generated graphs are acyclic, the ensemble algorithm is designed to add secondary arcs predicted by DGP to primary arcs predicted by DTP. Our results show that models using the multilingual encoder outperform ones using the language specific encoders for most languages. Moreover, the ensemble models generally show higher labeled attachment score on enhanced dependencies (ELAS) than the DTP and DGP models. As the result, our best parsing models rank the third place on the macro-average ELAS over 17 languages.

The original and the revised versions of PKT-UD are experimented with transformer-based parsing models using biaffine attention. The parsing model trained on the revised corpus shows a significant improvement of 3.0% in labeled attachment score over the model trained on the previous corpus. Our error analysis demonstrates that this revision allows the parsing model to learn relations more robustly, reducing several critical errors that used to be made by the previous model.},

@jurthesis{liu:20a,
	abstract = {Entity extraction problems have been extensively studied in terms of investigating the capability of extracting entities from text using natural language processing (NLP). Most research involves training learnable models on a large amount of corpus to ex- tract entities and determine their salience. Typically, these systems aim to retrieve an array of ranked entities from a set of documents while giving queries, which mainly measure the relevance between queries and entities. However, this thesis leverages semantic and syntactic information within the documents to perform entities extrac- tion as well as entity ranking. In particular, given document corpus, constituency parsing trees are constructed to extract entity mentions (phrases) for each article. Meanwhile, dependency parsing trees and entity coreference clusters are employed to build a relation graph, of which nodes denote entity mentions and edges denote mention relations. Moreover, graph convolution is performed on the relation graph to normalize the mention representation with respect to mention embeddings. Hi- erarchical density-based clustering and ranking mechanism are applied to compute entity priors. To evaluate this work, three models are proposed and evaluated on 60 annotated articles. Preliminary results illustrate that the usage of parsing trees, along with entity coreference relations improves the effectiveness of entity extraction and ranking. The interesting hierarchical trees for entity extraction, the principles for graph construction, as well as the system architecture serve as main contributions of this thesis.},

	abstract = {The sports topic handler has been one of the key components in our open-domain chatbot system competing for the Alexa Prize 2020, which is a university challenge for creating the best socialbots. This paper first gives a comprehensive description of a chatbot's sports topic handler, including its architecture and innovations. These innovations involve effective approaches to opinion-based state transition dialogue management that uses a daily updated database as well as derivation of engaging conversations on flashing events in sports. Given this topic handler, our chatbot is capable of makings multi-turn dialogues on any game, player, and team upon request by inferring statistical facts from the database and sharing its own opinions about the latest topics. This paper also presents the result of a user study on the sports topic handler which evaluates the impact of various modular improvements on the overall ratings provided by random users interacting with the chatbot. The impact of each update is evaluated extrinsically through the overall ratings. Our analysis finds a strong positive correlation between these updates and the user ratings, while also finds a negative correlation associated with uncovered topics and ignorance to the user input.},

Then, multi-task learning between the utterance prediction and the token span prediction is applied to fine-tune for span-based question answering (QA).

We then evaluate our simplified approaches on those three tasks using token embeddings generated by BERT. 12 datasets in both English

Moreover, an indepth analysis on the impact of BERT embeddings is provided using self-attention, which helps understanding in this rich yet representation. All models and source codes are available in public so that researchers can improve upon and utilize them to establish strong baselines for the next decade.},

However, attentive neural networks with contextual embeddings, which have achieved huge success in text classification, are rarely explored for this task. In this project, we have two major contributions. First, we create the first dialogue-based personality dataset, FriendsPersona , by annotating 5 personality traits of speakers from Friends TV Show through crowdsourcing. Second, we present a novel approach to automatic personality recognition using pre-trained contextual embeddings (BERT and RoBERTa) and attentive neural networks. Our models largely improve the state-of-art results on the monologue Essays dataset by 2.49%, and establish a solid benchmark on our FriendsPersona. By comparing results in two datasets, we demonstrate the challenges of modeling personality in multi-party dialogue.

In practice, these applications often need to be deployed with limited resources while keeping high accuracy. This paper touches the core of neural models in NLP, word embeddings, and presents a new embedding distillation framework that remarkably reduces the dimension of word embeddings without compromising accuracy. A novel distillation ensemble approach is also proposed that trains a high-efficient student model using multiple teacher models. In our approach, the teacher models play roles only during training such that the student model operates on its own without getting supports from the teacher models during decoding, which makes it eighty times faster and lighter than other typical ensemble methods. All models are evaluated on seven document classification datasets and show significant advantage over the teacher models for most cases. Our analysis depicts insightful transformation of word embeddings from distillation and suggests a future direction to ensemble approaches using neural models.},

While a significant portion of these questions ask for concise and well known facts, more complex questions do exist and they often require dedicated approaches to provide robust and accurate systems.

This thesis explores linguistically-oriented approaches for both factoid and non-factoid question answering and cross-genre text applications. The contributions include new annotation schemes for question answering oriented corpora, extracting linguistic structures and performing matching, and early exploration of conversation dialog text applications.

For sentence-based factoid question answering, a multi-stage crowdsourcing annotation scheme is presented. Next, a subtree matching algorithm for two sentences that aims to extract semantic similarity in open-domain texts is introduced and combined with a neural network architecture. Then, various factoid question answering corpora are thoroughly analyzed and cross-tested to improve the performance of QA systems. This thesis explores two complex scenarios of non-factoid question answering. In the first, a semantics-graph knowledge graph that is build on the top of linguistic structures is presented and applied on arithmetic questions using verb polarity classification. In the second, a system that combines lexical, syntactic and semantic text representations with statistical learning is presented and evaluated on event-based question answering. The last part of this thesis is focused on the cross-genre aspect of text in which the misalignment between the dialog and formal writings is the main challenge. First, an approach that combines semantic structure extraction with statistical learning is presented and used to improve the performance in the document retrieval task. Next, an exploration for the passage completion task is presented. A crowdsourcing annotation scheme is executed and a new corpus is created. A multi-gram convolutional neural network with the attention is compared to several state-of-the-art approaches for reading comprehension applications.},

	abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have been heavily used to predict various downstream clinical tasks such as readmission or mortality. One of the modalities in EHRs, clinical notes, has not been fully explored for these tasks due to its unstructured and inexplicable nature. Although recent advances in deep learning (DL) enables models to extract interpretable features from unstructured data, they often require a large amount of training data. However, many tasks in medical domains inherently consist of small sample data with lengthy documents; for a kidney transplant as an example, data from only a few thousand of patients are available and each patient's document consists of a couple of millions of words in major hospitals. Thus, complex DL methods cannot be applied to these kind of domains. In this paper, we present a comprehensive ensemble model using vector space modeling and topic modeling. Our proposed model is evaluated on the readmission task of kidney transplant patients, and improves 0.0211 in terms of c-statistics from the previous state- of-the-art approach using structured data, while typical DL methods fails to beat this approach. The proposed architecture provides the interpretable score for each feature from both modalities, structured and unstructured data, which is shown to be meaningful through a physician's evaluation.},

Unlike singular mentions each of which represents one entity, plural mentions stand for multiple entities. To tackle this aspect, we take the character identification corpus from the SemEval 2018 shared task that consists of entity annotation for singular mentions, and expand it by adding annotation for plural mentions. We then introduce a novel coreference resolution algorithm that selectively creates clusters to handle both singular and plural mentions, and also a deep learning-based entity linking model that jointly handles both types of mentions through multi-task learning. Adjusted evaluation metrics are proposed for these tasks as well to handle the uniqueness of plural mentions. Our experiments show that the new coreference resolution and entity linking models significantly outperform traditional models designed only for singular mentions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that plural mentions are thoroughly analyzed for these two resolution tasks.},

Given a dialog in text and a passage containing factual descriptions about the dialog where mentions of the characters are replaced by blanks, the task is to fill the blanks with the most appropriate character names that reflect the contexts in the dialog. Since there is no dataset that challenges the task of passage completion in this genre, we create a corpus by selecting transcripts from a TV show that comprise 1,682 dialogs, generating passages for each dialog through crowdsourcing, and annotating mentions of characters in both the dialog and the passages. Given this dataset, we build a deep neural model that integrates rich feature extraction from convolutional neural networks into sequence modeling in recurrent neural networks, optimized by utterance and dialog level attentions. Our model outperforms the previ- ous state-of-the-art model on this task in a dif- ferent genre using bidirectional LSTM, showing a 13.0+% improvement for longer dialogs. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of the attention mechanisms and suggests a direction to machine comprehension on multiparty dialog.},

	abstract = {This thesis gives two contributions in the form of lexical resourcesto (1) dependency parsing in Korean and (2) semantic parsing in English. First,we describe our methodology for building three dependency treebanks in Korean derived from existing treebanks and pseudo-annotated according to the latest guidelines from the Universal Dependencies (UD). The original Google Korean UD Treebank is re-tokenized to ensure morpheme-level annotation consistency with other corpora while maintaining linguistic validity of the revised tokens. Phrase structure trees in the Penn Korean Treebank and the Kaist Treebank are automatically converted into UD dependency trees by applying head-percolation rules and linguistically motivated heuristics. A total of 38K+ dependency trees are generated.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the three Korean treebanks are converted into UD dependency treebanks following the latest annotation guidelines. Second, we introduce an on-going project for augmenting the OntoNotes phrase structure treebank with semantic features found in the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), as part of an effort to build an accurate AMR parser. We propose a novel technique for AMR parsing that first trains a dependency parser on the OntoNotes corpus augmented with numbered arguments in the Proposition Bank (PropBank), and then does a transfer learning of the trained dependency parser for the AMR parsing task. A preliminary step is to prepare dependency data by performing an automatic replacement of dependencies that define predicate argument structure with their corresponding PropBank argument labels during constituent-to-dependency conversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the PropBank labels are directly inserted into dependency structure, producing a new dependency corpus with rich syntactic information as well as semantic role information provided by PropBank that fully describes the predicate-argument structure, making it an ideal resource for AMR parsing and, broadly, semantic parsing.},

	abstract = {Distributional Semantic word representation allows Natural Language Processing systems to extract and model an immense amount of information about a language. This technique maps words into a high dimensional continuous space through the use of a single-layer neural network. This process has allowed for advances in many Natural Language Processing research areas and tasks. These representation models are evaluated with the use of analogy tests, questions of the form ``If a is to a' then b is to what?'' are answered by composing multiple word vectors and searching the vector space.

During the neural network training process, each word is examined as a member of its context. Generally, a word's context is considered to be the elements adjacent to it within a sentence. While some work has been conducted examining the effect of expanding this definition, very little exploration has been done in this area. Further, no inquiry has been conducted as to the specific linguistic competencies of these models or whether modifying their contexts impacts the information they extract.

In this paper we propose a thorough analysis of the various lexical and grammatical competencies of distributional semantic models. We aim to leverage analogy tests to evaluate the most advanced distributional model across 14 different types of linguistic relationships. With this information we will then be able to investigate as to whether modifying the training context renders any differences in quality across any of these categories. Ideally we will be able to identify approaches to training that increase precision in some specific linguistic categories, which will allow us to investigate whether these improvements can be combined by joining the information used in different training approaches to build a single, improved, model.},

	abstract = {In today's age of big data, automatic processing techniques are becoming more important than ever, especially in the field of biology and medicine. Many studies focus on genomic data, following the rise of high throughput sequencing; this project instead analyzes certain blood data parameters taken from rhesus macaques housed in Yerkes Primate Research Center at Emory University. The initial impetus for this study was the Joyner et al. 2016 paper, ``Plasmodium cynomolgi infections in rhesus macaques display clinical and parasitological features pertinent to modelling vivax malaria pathology and relapse infections" (Joyner et al., 2016). Joyner and his team follow the infection of malaria strain. cynomolgiin monkeys, taking blood data and other biological information daily.  While the paper discusses possible points of difference between monkeys of varying disease severity, we endeavored to find an automatic way to use these ``clinical and parasitological features" to characterize and predict aspects of the infection, including severity and stage of malaria. We propose to replicate existing analyses and to add new insights via various computational techniques. Machine learning is traditionally used for very large datasets, and thus this thesis, limited to a small dataset by the exorbitant cost of studying monkeys, intends to provide a proof of concept for automatically analyzing these types of data. The flow of computation is as follows: normalization of data, creation of mathematical models, residual calculation, formation of residual matrices, and lastly the generation of regression models. The aforementioned pro-cedure is then applied to shifted data for comparison, using Bayesian optimization. This study therefore provides a comprehensive framework for automatic analysis of medical data, which can be applied to other datasets.},

	abstract = {This report gives guidelines of how to use a Propbank instance editor, Jubilee. Propbank is a cor- pus in which the arguments of each predicate are annotated with their semantic roles in relation to the predicate. In addition to semantic role annotation, Propbank annotation requires the choice of a sense id (also known as a roleset or frameset id) for each predicate. Thus, for each predicate in the Propbank, there exists a corresponding frameset file that shows the predicate argument structure of all senses related to the predicate. Jubilee facilitates the annotation process by displaying to the annotator several resources of syntactic and semantic information simultaneously: firstly, the syntactic structure of a sentence is displayed in the main frame using the Penn Treebank style of phrase structure; secondly, the available senses with their corresponding argument structures are displayed in another frame; thirdly, all available Propbank arguments including modifiers (e.g., ARG0, ARGM-TMP) are displayed for the annotator's choice; finally, example annotations of each sense of the predicate are available to the annotator for viewing whenever desired. The easy use of each resource allows the annotator to quickly absorb and apply the necessary syntactic and semantic information pertinent to each predicate for consistent and efficient annotation. Jubilee has been successfully adopted to Propbank projects in several organizations such as the University of Colorado at Boulder, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and Brandeis University. The tool runs platform independently, is light enough to run as an X11 application and supports multiple languages such as Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi and Korean.

	abstract = {This paper suggests a robust way of converting constituent-based trees in the Penn Treebank style into dependency trees for several different English corpora. For English, there already exist conversion tools. However, these tools are often customized enough for a specific corpus that they do not nec- essarily work as well when applied to different corpora involving newly introduced POS-tags or annotation schemes. The desire to improve conversion portability motivated us to build a new conversion tool that would produce more robust results across different corpora. In particular, we have modi- fied the treatment of head-percolation rules, function tags, coordination, gapping, and empty category mappings. We compare our method with the LTH conversion tool used for the CoNLL'07-09 shared tasks. For our experiments, we use 6 different English corpora from OntoNotes release 4.0. To demonstrate the impact our approach has on parsing, we train and test two state-of-the-art dependency parsers, MaltParser and MSTParser, and our own parser, ClearParser, using converted output from both the LTH tool and our method. Our results show that our method removes certain unnecessary non- projective dependencies and generates fewer unclassified dependencies. All three parsers give higher parsing accuracies on average across these corpora using data generated by our method; especially on semantic dependencies.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the retrieval of correct semantic boundaries for predicate-argument structures annotated by dependency structure. Unlike phrase structure, in which arguments are annotated at the phrase level, dependency structure does not have phrases so the argument labels are associated with head words instead: the subtree of each head word is assumed to include the same set of words as the annotated phrase does in phrase structure. However, at least in English, retrieving such subtrees does not always guarantee retrieval of the correct phrase boundaries. In this paper, we present heuristics that retrieve correct phrase boundaries for semantic arguments, called semantic boundaries, from dependency trees. By applying heuristics, we achieved an F1-score of 99.54% for correct representation of semantic boundaries. Furthermore, error analysis showed that some of the errors could also be considered correct, depending on the interpretation of the annotation.},

We begin by improving word alignments for verb predicates gener- ated by GIZA++ by using information available in parallel PropBanks. We applied the Kuhn-Munkres method to measure predicate-argument matching and improved verb predicate alignments by an F-score of 12.6%. Using the enhanced word alignments we checked the set of target verbs aligned to a specific source verb for semantic consistency. For a set of English verbs aligned to a Chinese verb, we checked if the English verbs belong to the same semantic class using an existing lexi- cal database, WordNet. For a set of Chinese verbs aligned to an English verb we manually checked semantic similarity between the Chinese verbs within a set. Our results show that the verb sets we generated have a high correla- tion with semantic classes. This could potentially lead to an automatic technique for generating semantic classes for verbs.},

	abstract = {This paper gives two contributions to dependency parsing in Korean. First, we build a Korean dependency Treebank from an existing constituent Treebank. For a morphologically rich language like Korean, dependency parsing shows some advantages over constituent parsing. Since there is not much training data available, we automatically generate dependency trees by applying head-percolation rules and heuristics to the constituent trees. Second, we show how to extract useful features for dependency parsing from rich morphology in Korean. Once we build the dependency Treebank, any statistical parsing approach can be applied. The challenging part is how to extract features from tokens consisting of multiple morphemes. We suggest a way of selecting important morphemes and use only these as features to avoid sparsity. Our parsing approach is evaluated on three different genres using both gold-standard and automatic morphological analysis. We also test the impact of fine vs. coarse-grained morphologies on dependency parsing. With automatic morphological analysis, we achieve labeled attachment scores of 80%+. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Korean dependency parsing has been evaluated on labeled edges with such a large variety of data.

@phdthesis{choi:12b,
	abstract = {This thesis focuses on the optimization of NLP components for robustness and scalability. Three kinds of nlp components are used for our experiments, a part-of-speech tagger, a dependency parser, and a semantic role labeler. For part-of-speech tagging, dynamic model selection is introduced. Our dynamic model selection approach builds two models, domain-specific and generalized models, and selects one of them during decoding by comparing similarities between lexical items used for building these models and input sentences. As a result, it gives robust tagging accuracy across corpora and shows fast tagging speed. For dependency parsing, a new transition-based parsing algorithm and a bootstrapping technique are introduced. Our parsing algorithm learns both projective and non-projective transitions so it can generate both projective and non-projective dependency trees yet shows linear time parsing speed on average. Our bootstrapping technique bootstraps parse information used as features for transition-based parsing, and shows significant improvement for parsing accuracy. For semantic role labeling, a conditional higher-order argument pruning algorithm is introduced. A higher-order pruning algorithm improves the coverage of argument candidates and shows improvement on the overall F1-score. The conditional higher-order pruning algorithm also noticeably reduces average labeling complexity with minimal reduction in F1-score.

For all experiments, two sets of training data are used; one is from the Wall Street Journal corpus, and the other is from the OntoNotes corpora. All components are evaluated on 9 different genres, which are grouped separately for in-genre and out-of-genre experiments. Our experiments show that our approach gives higher accuracies compared to other state-of-the-art nlp components, and runs fast, taking about 3-4 milliseconds per sentence for processing all three components. All components are publicly available as an open source project, called ClearNLP. We believe that this project is beneficial for many nlp tasks that need to process large-scale heterogeneous data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel way of improving POS tagging on heterogeneous data. First, two separate models are trained (generalized and domain-specific) from the same data set by controlling lexical items with different document frequencies. During decoding, one of the models is selected dynamically given the cosine similarity between each sentence and the training data. This dynamic model selec- tion approach, coupled with a one-pass, left-to-right POS tagging algorithm, is evaluated on corpora from seven different genres. Even with this simple tagging algorithm, our system shows comparable results against other state-of-the-art systems, and gives higher accuracies when evaluated on a mixture of the data. Furthermore, our system is able to tag about 32K tokens per second. We believe that this model selection approach can be applied to more sophisticated tagging algorithms and improve their robustness even further.},

	abstract = {This paper examines both linguistic behavior and practical implications of empty argument insertion in the Hindi PropBank. The Hindi PropBank is annotated on the Hindi Dependency Treebank, which contains some empty categories but rarely the empty arguments of verbs. In this paper, we analyze four kinds of empty arguments, *PRO*, *REL*, *GAP*, *pro*, and suggest effective ways of annotating these arguments. Empty arguments such as *PRO* and *REL* can be inserted deterministically; we present linguistically motivated rules that automatically insert these arguments with high accuracy. On the other hand, it is difficult to find deterministic rules to insert *GAP* and *pro*; for these arguments, we introduce a new annotation scheme that concurrently handles both semantic role labeling and empty category insertion, producing fast and high quality annotation. In addition, we present algorithms for finding antecedents of *REL* and *PRO*, and discuss why finding antecedents for some types of *PRO* is difficult.},

@article{verspoor:12a,
	abstract = {Background
We introduce the linguistic annotation of a corpus of 97 full-text biomedical publications, known as the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus. We further assess the performance of existing tools for performing sentence splitting, tokenization, syntactic parsing, and named entity recognition on this corpus.

Results
Many biomedical natural language processing systems demonstrated large differences between their previously published results and their performance on the CRAFT corpus when tested with the publicly available models or rule sets. Trainable systems differed widely with respect to their ability to build high-performing models based on this data.

Conclusions
The finding that some systems were able to train high-performing models based on this corpus is additional evidence, beyond high inter-annotator agreement, that the quality of the CRAFT corpus is high. The overall poor performance of various systems indicates that considerable work needs to be done to enable natural language processing systems to work well when the input is full-text journal articles. The CRAFT corpus provides a valuable resource to the biomedical natural language processing community for evaluation and training of new models for biomedical full text publications.},

@article{albright:13a,
	abstract = {Objective
To create annotated clinical narratives with layers of syntactic and semantic labels to facilitate advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP).
To develop NLP algorithms and open source components.

Methods
Manual annotation of a clinical narrative corpus of 127 606 tokens following the Treebank schema for syntactic information, PropBank schema for predicate-argument structures, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) schema for semantic information. NLP components were developed.

Results
The final corpus consists of 13 091 sentences containing 1772 distinct predicate lemmas. Of the 766 newly created PropBank frames, 74 are verbs. There are 28 539 named entity (NE) annotations spread over 15 UMLS semantic groups, one UMLS semantic type, and the Person semantic category. The most frequent annotations belong to the UMLS semantic groups of Procedures (15.71%), Disorders (14.74%), Concepts and Ideas (15.10%), Anatomy (12.80%), Chemicals and Drugs (7.49%), and the UMLS semantic type of Sign or Symptom (12.46%). Inter-annotator agreement results: Treebank (0.926), PropBank (0.891--0.931), NE (0.697--0.750). The part-of-speech tagger, constituency parser, dependency parser, and semantic role labeler are built from the corpus and released open source. A significant limitation uncovered by this project is the need for the NLP community to develop a widely agreed-upon schema for the annotation of clinical concepts and their relations.

Conclusions
This project takes a foundational step towards bringing the field of clinical NLP up to par with NLP in the general domain. The corpus creation and NLP components provide a resource for research and application development that would have been previously impossible.},

We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transition- based parser that uses beam search.},

However, since alignment itself is a challenging task and is often noisy, existing systems either align conservatively, resulting in very few links, or combine the attributes of multiple candidates, leading to a conflation of entities. Our approach instead maintains ranked lists of candidate entities that are dynamically merged and reranked during inference. Further, we incorporate a large set of surface string variations for each entity by using anchor texts from the web that link to the entity. These forms of global context enable our system to outperform a competitive baseline without a knowledge base by 1.09 B3 F1 points, and a state-of- the-art system by 0.41 points on the ACE 2004 data.},

With this in mind, it is not surprising that Twitter and other social media services have played an important role in shaping the political debate during the 2016 presidential election. The dynamics of social media provide a unique opportunity to detect and interpret the pivotal events and scandals of the candidates quantitatively. This paper examines several text-based analysis to determine which topics have a lasting impact on the election for the two main candidates, Clinton and Trump. About 135.5 million tweets are collected over the six weeks prior to the election. From these tweets, topic clustering, keyword extraction, and tweeter analysis are performed to better understand the impact of the events occurred during this period. This analysis builds upon a social science foundation to provide another avenue for scholars to use in discerning how events detected from social media show the impacts of campaigns as well as campaign the election.},

	abstract = {Technical documents contain a fair amount of unnatural language, such as tables, formulas, and pseudo-code. Unnatural language can be an important factor of confusing existing NLP tools. This paper presents an effective method of distinguishing unnatural language from natural language, and evaluates the impact of unnatural language detection on NLP tasks such as document clustering. We view this problem as an information extraction task and build a multiclass classification model identifying unnatural language components into four categories. First, we create a new annotated corpus by collecting slides and papers in various formats, PPT, PDF, and HTML, where unnatural language components are annotated into four categories. We then explore features available from plain text to build a statistical model that can handle any format as long as it is converted into plain text. Our experiments show that removing unnatural language components gives an absolute improvement in document clustering by up to 15%. Our corpus and tool are publicly available.

We first augment and correct several cases of annotation errors in an existing corpus so the corpus is clearer and cleaner for statistical learning.

We then propose another neural model that employs the embeddings learned and creates cluster embeddings for entity linking.

While most previous works on this task rely heavily on acoustic features, our approach attempts to identify speakers in dialogues using their speech patterns as captured by transcriptions to the TV show. It has been shown that different individual speakers exhibit distinct idiolec- tal styles. Several convolutional neural network models are developed to discriminate between differing speech patterns.

Transcripts of TV shows are collected as the sources of our corpus and automatically annotated with mentions by linguistically-motivated rules. These mentions are manually linked to their referents and disambiguate with abstract referent labels through crowdsourcing. Our annotated corpus comprises 448 scenes from 2 seasons and 46 episodes of the TV show Friends, and shows the inter-annotator agreement of kappa = 79.96. For statistical modeling, this task is reformulated as coreference resolution, and experimented with two state-of-the-art systems on our corpus. A novel mention-to-mention ranking model is proposed to provides better mention and mention-pair representations learned from feature groupings of dialogue-specific features After linking coreferent clusters to their referent entity with our proposed rule-based remap- ping algorithm, the best model gives a purity score of 57.27% on average, which is promising given the challenging nature of this task and our corpus.},

Distinguished from previous studies, our approach embraces a double-annotated dataset and strays away from obscure ``black-box'' models to comprehensive deep learning models. In this paper, we present a novel neural attention mechanism that not only classifies clinically important findings. Specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention analysis are used to classify radiology head computed tomography reports based on five categories that radiologists would account for in assessing acute and communicable findings in daily practice. The experiments show that our CNN attention models outperform non-neural models, especially when trained on a larger dataset. Our attention analysis demonstrates the intuition behind the classifier's decision by generating a heatmap that highlights attended terms used by the CNN model; this is valuable when potential downstream medical decisions are to be performed by human experts or the classifier information is to be used in cohort construction such as for epidemiological studies.},

Our work is distinguished from previous work concerning the generation of shallow dependency trees such that it generates dependency graphs incorporating deep structures in which relations stay consistent regardless of their surface positions, and derives relations between out-of-domain arguments, caused by syntactic variations such as open clause, relative clause, or coordination, and their predicates so the complete argument structures are represented for both verbal and non-verbal predicates. Our deep dependency graph conversion recovers important argument relations that would be missed by dependency tree conversion, and merges syntactic and semantic relations into one unified representation, which can reduce the bundle of developing another layer of annotation dedicated for predicate argument structures. Our graph conversion method is applied to six corpora in English and generated over 4.6M dependency graphs covering 20 different genres.},

	abstract = {Community-based Question Answering (CQA) services allow users to find and share information by interacting with others. A key to the success of CQA services is the quality and timeliness of the responses that users get. With the increasing use of mobile devices, searchers increasingly expect to find more local and time-sensitive information, such as the current special at a cafe around the corner. Yet, few services provide such hyper-local and time-aware question answering. This requires intelligent content recommendation and careful use of notifications (e.g., recommending questions to only selected users). To explore these issues, we developed RealQA, a real-time CQA system with a mobile interface, and performed two user studies: a formative pilot study with the initial system design, and a more extensive study with the revised UI and algorithms. The research design combined qualitative survey analysis and quantitative behavior analysis under different con- ditions. We report our findings of the prevalent information needs and types of responses users provided, and of the effectiveness of the recommendation and notification strategies on user experience and satisfaction. Our system and findings offer insights and implications for designing real-time CQA systems, and provide a valuable platform for future research.},

	abstract = {Distributional Semantic word representation allows Natural Language Processing systems to extract and model an immense amount of information about a language. This technique maps words into a high dimensional continuous space through the use of a single-layer neural network. This process has allowed for advances in many Natural Language Processing research areas and tasks. These representation models are evaluated with the use of analogy tests, questions of the form ``If a is to a' then b is to what?'' are answered by composing multiple word vectors and searching the vector space.

During the neural network training process, each word is examined as a member of its context. Generally, a word's context is considered to be the elements adjacent to it within a sentence. While some work has been conducted examining the effect of expanding this definition, very little exploration has been done in this area. Further, no inquiry has been conducted as to the specific linguistic competencies of these models or whether modifying their contexts impacts the information they extract.

In this paper we propose a thorough analysis of the various lexical and grammatical competencies of distributional semantic models. We aim to leverage analogy tests to evaluate the most advanced distributional model across 14 different types of linguistic relationships. With this information we will then be able to investigate as to whether modifying the training context renders any differences in quality across any of these categories. Ideally we will be able to identify approaches to training that increase precision in some specific linguistic categories, which will allow us to investigate whether these improvements can be combined by joining the information used in different training approaches to build a single, improved, model.},

	abstract = {Computational semantics as a field includes many of the unsolved problems of Natural Language Processing. The need for innovation in this field has motivated much research in developing word and language models that better represent meaning and various concepts within semantics. This thesis is concerned specifically with measuring verb similarity and verb clustering, a task within this field. The goal is to develop representations of verbs that can accurately and viably be used to judge semantic similarity between verbs and to group verbs into classes that reflect their relatedness in meaning. Verb clustering - a task of distributing verbs into semantically related classes - has in previous research been shown to have applications in multiple tasks in Natural Language Processing including word sense disambiguation. This thesis will present and compare several methods of automatic acquisition of verb similarity, with a goal of allowing future applications of these methods in NLP tasks and to promote discoveries in how the mechanisms modeled by these methods relate to linguistics.

This paper presents several methods from verb clustering based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation - a probabilistic graphical model commonly used for topic modelling. We model verbs as collections of contextual features derived from latent classes. LDA, which is designed as a model for Bayesian inference of latent thematic categories, fits well to model verb classes based on linguistic context. We demonstrate Recursive LDA, a procedure of executing LDA iteratively to produce a hierarchical structure of classes. We test several linguistic features from syntax and lexical arguments of verbs with interest in identifying how informative each feature is. We evaluate all of our experiments against human judgments of similarity providing a novel method for evaluating semantic similarity metrics of word models. We test all of our data on a list of 3,000 most common English verbs.

We test our method against Word2Vec, a popular and recently developed word model using skip-gram feature vectors refined by deep learning. The results in this thesis will show that given the right features, our method of using LDA with linguistic features outperforms Word2Vec's data-driven statistical approach when weighed against human judgements.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a subtask of entity linking, called character identification, that maps mentions in multiparty conversation to their referent characters. Transcripts of TV shows are collected as the sources of our corpus and automatically annotated with mentions by linguistically-motivated rules. These mentions are manually linked to their referents through crowdsourcing. Our corpus comprises 543 scenes from two TV shows, and shows the inter-annotator agreement of $\kappa$ = 79.96. For statistical modeling, this task is reformulated as coreference resolution, and experimented with a state-of-the-art system on our corpus. Our best model gives a purity score of 69.21 on average, which is promising given the challenging nature of this task and our corpus.},

Our dataset is unique in a sense that it is annotated on question answer pairs collected from multiple genres, useful for developing advanced QA systems. Our annotation scheme makes clear distinctions between 4 types of it, providing guidelines for many erroneous cases. Several statistical models are built for the classification of it, showing encouraging results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a corpus is created for question answering.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel technique called dynamic feature induction that keeps inducing high dimensional features automatically until the feature space becomes `more' linearly separable. Dynamic feature induction searches for the feature combinations that give strong clues for distinguishing certain label pairs, and generates joint features from these combinations. These induced features are trained along with the primitive low dimensional features. Our approach was evaluated on two core NLP tasks, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition, and showed the state-of-the-art results for both tasks, achieving the accuracy of 97.64 and the F1-score of 91.00 respectively, with about a 25% increase in the feature space.},

At the same time, the use of dependency parsing in NLP applications has increased. It can be difficult for a non-expert to select a good ``off-the-shelf'' parser. We present a comparative analysis of ten leading statistical dependency parsers on a multi-genre corpus of English. For our analysis, we developed a new web-based tool that gives a convenient way of comparing dependency parser outputs. Our analysis will help practitioners choose a parser to optimize their desired speed/accuracy trade-off, and our tool will help practitioners examine and compare parser output.},

There are four kinds of entity relations added to our knowledge graph: syntactic dependencies, semantic role labels, named entities, and coreference links, which can be effectively applied to answer complex questions. As a proof of concept, we demon- strate how our knowledge graph can be used to solve complex questions such as arithmetics. Our experiment shows a promising result on solving arithmetic questions, achieving the 3-folds cross-validation score of 71.75%.},

In this research we ex- tend Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for use in the identification of future-referring sentences. Building off a set of hand-designed rules, we trained a ADAGRAD classifier to be able to automatically detect sentences referring to the future. Uni-bi-trigram and syntactic rule mixed feature was found to provide the highest accuracy. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) indicated the existence of four major categories of future orientation. Lastly, the results of these analyses were found to correlate with a range of behavioral measures, offering evidence in support of the psychological reality of the categories.},
